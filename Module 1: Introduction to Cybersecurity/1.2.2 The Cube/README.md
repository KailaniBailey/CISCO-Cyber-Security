# The Cube

MODULE NOTES:

The **McCumber Cube** is a model framework created by John McCumber in 1991 to help organizations establish and evaluate information security initiatives by considering all of the related factors that impact them. This security model has three dimensions:
  - The foundational principles for protecting information systems.
  - The protection of information in each of its possible states.
  - The security measures used to protect data.

## The Foundational Principles for Protecting Information
**Confidentiality** is a set of rules that prevents sensitives information from being disclosed to unauthorized people, resources and processes. Methods include:
- data encryption
- identity proofing
- two factor authentication

**Integrity** ensures that system information or processes are protected from intentional or accidental modification. One way to ensure integrity is to use:
- hash function
- checksum

**Availability** means that authorized users are able to access systems and data when and where needed and those that do not meet established conditions, are not. This can be achieved by:
- maintaining equipment
- performing hardware repairs
- keeping operating systems and software up to date
- creating backups

## The Protection of Information in Each State 
**Processing** refers to data that is being used to perform an operation such as updating a database record (data *in process*).

**Storage** refers to data stored in memory or on a permanent storage device such as a hard drive, solid-state drive or USB drive (data *at rest*).

**Transmission** refers to data traveling between information systems (data *in transit*).

# The Security Measures Used to Protect Data
**Awareness, training and education** are the measures put in place by an organization to ensure that users are knowledgeable about potential security threats and the actions they can take to protect information systems.
