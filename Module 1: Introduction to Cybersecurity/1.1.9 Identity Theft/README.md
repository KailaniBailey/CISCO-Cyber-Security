# Identity Theft

MODULE NOTES:

- Cybercriminals are invested in the long-term gain of identity theft.
    - **Medical (Identity) Theft:** Stealing medical insurance to use the benefits for themselves. These procedures will be carried out in your name then saved in your medical records.
    - **Banking:** Can help cybercriminals access bank accounts, credit cards, social profiles and other online accounts. An identity thief could file a fake tax return and collect the refund, could even take out loans in your name and ruin your credit score (and life).
