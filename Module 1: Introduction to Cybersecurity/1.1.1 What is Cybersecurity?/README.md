# What is Cybersecurity?
MODULE NOTES:

**Cyber Security** is the ongoing effort to protect individuals, organizations and governments from digital attacks by protecting networked systems and data from unauthorized use or harm.
  - On a **personal** level, we need to safeguard our identity, our data, and our computing devices.
  - At an **organizational** level, it's everyone's responsibility to protect the organization's reputation, data and customers.
  - As more digital information is being gathered and shared, its protection becomes even more vital at the **government** level, where national security, econimic stability and the safety and well-being of citizens are at stake.
