# Your Online Identity
MODULE NOTES:

- When choosing a username, it's important not to reveal any personal information.
    - Don't use full name or parts of address or phone number.
    - Don't use email username for professional accounts.
    - Don't use the same username and password combination, especially on financial accounts.
    - Don't choose a super-odd username and then reuse it again and again - it makes you easier to track.
    - Don't choose a username that gives clues to passwords.
    - Do choose a username that's appropriate for the type of account (business, social, personal).
