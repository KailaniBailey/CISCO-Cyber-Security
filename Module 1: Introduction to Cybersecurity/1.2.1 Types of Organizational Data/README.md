# Types of Organizational Data

MODULE NOTES:

1. **Traditional Data:** Typically generated and maintained by all organizations, big and small.
   - **Transactional Data** such as details relating to buying/selling, production activities and basic organizational operations (any info used to make employment decisions).
   - **Intellectual Property** such as patents, trademarks, and new product plans (allows an organization to gain economic advantage over its competitors). This info is often considered a trade secret. Losing it could prove disastrous.
   - **Financial data** such as income statements, balance sheets/cash flow statements.

2. **Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data** is a large network of physical objects, software and other equipment. All of these 'things' are connected to the internet, with the ability to collect and share data.
   - IoT has led to an exponential growth in data, creating a new area of interest in tech/business called 'Big Data'.
