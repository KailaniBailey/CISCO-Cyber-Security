# Smart Devices

MODULE NOTES:

Consider how often you use computing devices to access your personal data. This happens quite often unless you've decided to recieve paper statements. You access digital copies of bank account statements and have probably transferred the required funds via mobile banking app when paying a bill.
  - Computing devices can also generate information about you.
  - Wearable devices collect data for clinical research, patient health monitoring, and fitness and well-being tracking.
  - Privacy can be the price we pay for digital convenience.
  - Do social media companies 'sell' consumer data OR 'share' consumer data with marketing partners?
