# Where is Your Data?

MODULE NOTES:

Summarizing the scenario that's mentioned in the module, taking photos of things with your mobile device (cell phone) automatically saves them to that device. When you share those photos with your friends and social media profiles, that means other people are able to download said photos and do whatever they want with them. **The photos are no longer just on your device.** They've ended up on servers located in different parts of the world and people you don't know have access to your photos.
