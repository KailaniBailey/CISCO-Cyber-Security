# Your Data

MODULE NOTES:

- **Personal data** describes any data about you, including your name, SSN, DL#, date and place of birth, your mother's maiden name, even pics or messages that you exchange with family and friends.
    - **Cybercriminals** can use this information to identify and impersonate you, infringing on your privacy and potentially causing serious damage to your reputation.
    - **Medical Records:** Every time you visit the doctor, personal information regarding physical, mental health and well-being is added to your Electronic Health Records (EHRs). You need to be aware of the medical information you share since majority of these records are kept online, i.e. fitness trackers (heart rate, blood pressure and blood sugar levels), which are transferred, stored and displayed via the cloud.
    - **Education Records:** Contain information about academic qualifications and achievements. These records may also include your contact information, attendance records, disciplinary records, health and immunization records as well as special education records including individualized education programs (IEPs).
    - **Employment and Financial Records:** Can be valuable to gather information on your past employment, or even current. Financial records may include information about income and expenses. Tax records may include paychecks, credit card statements, credit rating and bank account details.
