# What Do Hackers Want?

MODULE NOTES:

Of course, cybercriminals and hackers want money, i.e. attempting to access financial information online.
  - A **cybercriminal** can take advantage of your relationships, accessing online accounts and appealing to one's good nature as a way to trick a person into wiring money to others in a time of need. They can impersonate family members and claim they need money wired ASAP due to some horrible event that 'happened' to them.
  - "In 2015, cybercriminals hacked approx. 10,000 American Airlines and United accounts, booking free flights and upgrades using stolen credentials."
  - They can also steal your identity and ruin your life.
